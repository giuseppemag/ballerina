# Molecules

## Definition

Molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit.

### Molecules must:

- Group of atoms bonded together
- Smallest fundamental unit of a compound
- More concrete than atoms
- Encourage a "do one thing and do it well" philosophy
- Often serve as the backbone for a more complex system

## TL;DR

Can import atoms in itself. Are designed to serve as a grouping matter. Like a parent for its children.
